## The Story

Steven is a friend of mine and fellow BYX brother. Last December, he approached 
me and announced that he was going to run for Senior Yell Leader of Texas A&M. This was 
an extremely exciting aspiration, as I have seen Steven demonstrate his natural gift for 
leading others during my time at Texas A&M. However, this is was an incredibly daunting 
task, because the Texas A&M student body is generally resistant towards non-reg, (non-Corps 
of Cadets), Yell Leader candidates.

## The Task

In hopes of helping Steven win the majority vote of the student body in the February 2015 
elections, I created for him a campaign website on which he could share his story behind 
why he chose to run for Yell Leader, encourage students to get involved in his campaign, 
and keep voters informed with important dates and events.

In scoping out the requirements for this project, I made a three important observations:

**1. The visual design of the site needs to clearly present Steven as the top candidate.**

In order to win votes, the site needed to have a degree of professionalism and polish that 
would make a positive first impression on site visitors. At the very top of the page is 
a large picture of Steven next to his campaign slogan, Get Loud For Lanz. If there was 
anything I wanted to impress on site visitors, it was his slogan and his character.

I also wanted to use visual design elements that students were familiar with. Many of the 
site's colors come from the University's brand guidelines, which students are used to seeing all 
over campus. As a result, Steven could be closer associated with all of the core values that 
Texas A&M stands for.

**2. Site information needs to be updated on the fly.**

Campaign week is always crazy and hectic. Event dates and times are always subject to change, 
and so I needed a way to update this information whenever and wherever. By hosting the site 
through GitHub pages, I had the ability to log in from any device to quickly make small changes.
There was one case where Steven needed the time of one of his events to be pushed back a few hours, 
and I was able to modify the site's content from my cell phone while sitting in class!

**3. The site needs to be responsive to a wide range of devices.**

College students are always on their phones, checking social media to find information 
on what's happening around campus. There are a wide variety of screen resolutions that 
must be supported by the site. From a web design standpoint, this need is met by 
using Responsive Web Design techniques to ensure that the content of the page 
scales appropriately to the device it is being viewed on.

## The Result

![](/img/getloudforlanziphone.png){: .small.right} After the ballots were tallied, **Steven 
won the election**, the first non-reg Yell Leader candidate to win in several years. The site 
garnered **1750+ unique visitors** during the campaign week, which contributed to the 
**4198 overall votes** that Steven received.

I worked in collaboration with Steven's campaign team to obtain the campaign media presented 
on the site. Special thanks to [Kyle Roberts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kylearoberts), Steven's 
videographer and photographer, who did an incredible job creating many of the site assets.

Congratulations to Steven and his campaign team in their victory. All of your hard work paid off, and 
I'm excited to see Steven represent our university as Senior Yell Leader.
