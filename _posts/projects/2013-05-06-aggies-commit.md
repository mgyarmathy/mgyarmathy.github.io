<h2>The Story</h2>

_Aggies Commit To Learning For A Lifetime_ was an initiative created by Texas A&M University 
in 2012 to encourage students to commit to a lifetime of learning to prepare themselves 
for leadership responsibilites and service to society they will encounter after graduation. 
In order to foster an additude of learning for a lifetime, Aggies Commit aims to encourage 
students to participate in higher learning experiences outside of the classroom, 
such as internships, student research, and study abroad programs.

As a way of embodying what Aggies Commit is all about, the Texas A&M Office of the Provost 
reached out to me, a university student, to help them take on the task of designing and 
developing the visual design of the Aggies Commit site.

## The Task

The purpose of the Aggies Commit site is: (1) to explain to students and faculty what Aggies 
Commit is all about, (2) to allow students to share stories of their higher education experiences, 
and (3) to connect students to opportunities for higher learning experiences. 

Like many public universities, a large majority of Texas A&M's websites favor functionality 
over form and often compromise visual quality as a result. In designing this site, my primary 
objective was to deliver a up-to-date design that is attractive to a diverse audience of students and 
faculty without compromising the official brand guidelines of Texas A&M University.
