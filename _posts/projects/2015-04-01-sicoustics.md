## The Story

Sicoustics is an up-and-coming technology start-up seeking to revolutionize the way we do event audio, particularly for distance races. Through distributed mobile speaker systems, race planners can broadcast music and the message of their event throughout the entire course. As Sicoustics continues to grow, they sought me out to improve their existing website's design and to develop some exciting new features.

## The Task

The primary objective in this project was to improve Sicoustics' lead generation process. In our initial planning meeting, I was told that over 90% of Sicoustics' customers chose to use their product after receiving a live demonstration.

We came up with the solution to create a custom "Build an Event" form component where users could designate their event's purpose and race type(s) in order to receive a quote.

The site also was in need of a few visual style improvements to make the site's layout and design more consistent. These improvements included reorganizing some of the site's content in a manner that made more sense, presenting the most engaging information first and letting the details follow. I also added a hero image to the top of the site to emphasize the Sicoustics brand.

## The Result 

![](/img/sicousticsiphone.png){: .small.right} The redesign of Sicoustics.com turned out wonderfully. I was especially pleased with the new Build An Event form component. To make this component more intuitive, I used [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com/) to take the user's form inputs and generate an automatic message for the contact form. This, in practice, removes a barrier in the lead generation process and adds to the overall user experience.

The site redesign has added a lot of value to Sicoustics' online presence. The visual style improvements improved the company's credibility, which helps attract new customers, and by streamlining the lead generation process, Sicoustics expects to see an increase in their conversion rates.
