## The Story

BYX Island Party at Texas A&amp;M University is an annual outdoor music festival hosted 
by Beta Upsilon Chi Fraternity. Island Party is an evangelical outreach event for the 
Bryan/College Station community as well as a philanthropy event to raise money for 
nonprofit organizations. I have been involved with BYX since my freshman year of college, 
and in order to help them in their advertising efforts, I gave the Island Party website 
a much-needed redesign, free of charge.

## The Task

In scoping out the requirements for this project, I made a few important observations:

**1. The site needs to be responsive to a wide range of devices.**

College students are always on their phones, checking social media to find information 
on what's happening around campus. There are a wide variety of screen resolutions that 
must be supported by the site. From a web design standpoint, this need is met by 
using Responsive Web Design techniques to ensure that the content of the page 
scales appropriately to the device it is being viewed on.

**2. The visual design of the site needs to reflect the attitude of the event.**

As an outreach event, Island Party is meant to have a welcoming, easy-going atmosphere. 
Not only does it appeal to college students, but families in the Bryan/College Station 
Community are encouraged to attend.

In order to attract a large amount of college students, Island Party takes notes from 
other popular music festivals, such as Austin City Limits, to make the event as fun 
as possible. Likewise, I looked to popular music festival websites for inspiration.

Lastly, a lot of fundraising goes into Island Party, so there was a need to demonstrate 
professionalism to show sponsors that their brands would be represented well.

**3. Event information needs to be easily accessible.**

Hundreds of people would be visiting the site on the day of the event to view the lineup 
and schedule of events. This means that site navigation needs to be straightforward and 
easily identifiable.

## The Result

I was very pleased with how the site turned out. I opted for a single page layout with a 
fixed navigation bar to allow site visitors to quickly scroll between various portions of
the page.

collaboration with a few of my fellow BYX brothers. The Island Party 2014 logo was designed 
by Brian Hutson. I also worked with my buddy Grant over at 
[Grant Daniels Photography](http://www.grantdanielsphotography.com/) 
to supply the site's header images.

From a logistical standpoint, the site redesign added a lot of value to BYX Island Party's 
fundraising campaign. BYX was able to raise **$36,000** for the event, a number *far greater* 
than any historical numbers. The site also established a solid web presence for the event to
be shared on social media platforms and greatly influenced event attendance. In fact, **Island 
Party 2014 broke attendance records for both days of the event**.
