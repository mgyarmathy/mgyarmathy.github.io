## The Story

This past summer, my sister Chelsea reached out to me about a home interior and lifestyle blog she wanted to create. She called it Craft & Composition, a place where she could share her "love for the Craft of all things functional and beautiful and the Composition of storied homes".

Craft and Composition is inspired by Chelsea's "satisfaction of giving new life to furniture with old stories" and her love for "rubber stamps, vinyl records, and fresh white hydrangeas."

Knowing my experience with web development, Chelsea asked me to create a custom WordPress theme for her new project.

## The Task

WordPress is a great platform for blogging and posting content to share with others. It also allows enough freedom to customize and tweak every component of the site to achieve exactly what is desired.

I stared with the [Underscores](http://underscores.me) starter theme as a boilerplate for my custom WordPress theme development. Underscores is a wonderful starting point for any WordPress project because it incorporates many of the best practices established by some of the best developers in the industry.

Chelsea also wanted to include Pinterest and Instagram integration where she could display content from her posts that she cross-posts across other social media platforms.

## The Result

The Craft and Composition site features a two-column layout, with the posts on the left and the author's information and other widgets on the right. This custom theme is fully-responsive, so it scales nicely to a wide range of devices.

At the time of writing this post, Chelsea has covered six different projects on her blog, achieving a viewership in the hundreds. She has also started a mailing list through [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com/) to notify subscribers when she posts new content.
